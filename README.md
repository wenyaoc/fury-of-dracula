This assignment is based on a real game called The Fury of Dracula, but the rules have been simplified for this assignment. The assignment might be more accurately called “Dracula Runs and Hides”, as the whole idea is that four hunters are chasing Dracula and he is trying to evade them. Every time they catch him he loses some blood, and eventually, if he loses enough blood, he is vanquished. Dracula does the best he can to stay ahead of the hunters, who do the best they can to find him.
